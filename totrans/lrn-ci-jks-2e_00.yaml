- en: In the past few years, the agile model of software development has seen a considerable
    amount of growth around the world. There is massive demand for a software delivery
    solution that is fast and flexible to frequent amendments, especially in the e-commerce
    sector. As a result, the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery methodologies
    are gaining popularity.

    detection, avoiding lousy code into production, and faster delivery, which leads
    to an increase in productivity.

- en: This book, *Learning Continuous Integration with Jenkins Second Edition*, serves
    as a step-by-step guide to setting up a Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery,
    and Continuous Deployment system using hands-on examples. The book is 20% theory
    and 80% practical. It starts by explaining the concept of Continuous Integration
    and its significance in the Agile world, with a complete chapter dedicated to
    this. Users then learn to configure and set up Jenkins, followed by implementing
    Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery using Jenkins. There is also a
    small chapter on Continuous Deployment, which talks primarily about the difference
    between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment.
