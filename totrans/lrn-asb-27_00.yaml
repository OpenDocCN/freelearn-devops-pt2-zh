- en: The information technology sector is a fast-moving sector that always tries
    to accelerate. To keep up with this, companies need to be able to move quickly
    and iterate frequently. Until a few years back, this was mainly true for software,
    but now we start to see the necessity of developing infrastructure at a similar
    speed. Going forward, we will need to change the infrastructure we run our software
    on at the speed of the software itself.

- en: In this scenario, many technologies, such as software-defined everything (storage,
    network, and compute, for example), will be key, but those technologies need to
    be managed in an equally scalable way, and that way will involve using Ansible
    and similar products.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ansible is highly relevant today, since, unlike competing products, it is agentless,
    allowing for faster deployments, more security, and better auditability.
