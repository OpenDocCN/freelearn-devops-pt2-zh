- en: Jenkins is a Java-based Continuous Integration (CI) server that supports the
    discovery of defects early in the software cycle. Thanks to a rapidly growing
    number of plugins (currently over 1,000), Jenkins communicates with many types
    of systems, building and triggering a wide variety of tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CI involves making small changes to software and then building and applying
    quality assurance processes. Defects do not only occur in the code, but also appear
    in naming conventions, documentation, how the software is designed, build scripts,
    the process of deploying the software to servers, and so on. CI forces the defects
    to emerge early, rather than waiting for software to be fully produced. If defects
    are caught in the later stages of the software development life cycle, the process
    will be more expensive. The cost of repair radically increases as soon as the
    bugs escape to production. Estimates suggest it is 100 to 1,000 times cheaper
    to capture defects early. Effective use of a CI server, such as Jenkins, could
    be the difference between enjoying a holiday and working unplanned hours to heroically
    save the day. And as you can imagine, in my day job as a senior developer with
    aspirations for quality assurance, I like long boring days, at least for mission-critical
    production environments.
  prefs: []

- en: Jenkins can automate the building of software regularly and trigger tests pulling
    in the results and failing based on defined criteria. Failing early via build
    failure lowers the costs, increases confidence in the software produced, and has
    the potential to morph subjective processes into an aggressive metrics-based process
    that the development team feels is unbiased.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Maintaining Jenkins"), *Maintaining Jenkins*,
    describes common maintenance tasks such as backing up and monitoring. The recipes
    in this chapter outline methods for proper maintenance that in turn lowers the
    risk of failures.'

    deploying enterprise infrastructure such as a directory service, and a SSO solution
    to automatically test for the OWASP top 10 security.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Building Software"), *Building Software*,
    reviews the relationship between Jenkins and Maven builds and a small amount of
    scripting with Groovy and Ant. The recipes include checking for license violations,
    controlling the creation of reports, running Groovy scripts, and plotting alternative
    metrics.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Communicating Through Jenkins"), *Communicating
    Through Jenkins*, reviews effective communication strategies for different target
    audiences from developers and project managers to the wider public. Jenkins is
    a talented communicator, with its hordes of plugins notifying you by e-mail, dashboards,
    and Google services. It shouts at you through mobile devices, radiates information
    as you walk pass big screens, and fires at you with USB sponge missile launchers.'

    Metrics to Improve Quality*, explores the use of source code metrics. To save
    money and improve quality, you need to remove defects in the software life cycle
    as early as possible. Jenkins test automation creates a safety net of measurements.
    The recipes in this chapter will help you build this safety net.'

    application and web services. Two typical setup recipes are included. The first
    is the deployment of a WAR file through Jenkins to an application server. The
    second is the creation of multiple slave nodes, ready to move the hard work of
    testing away from the master node.'
