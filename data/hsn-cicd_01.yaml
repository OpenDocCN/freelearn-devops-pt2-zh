- en: In this book, we will look at the concepts of **continuous integration** (**CI**)
    and **continuous delivery** (**CD**) and apply these concepts using tools such
    as Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI. There will be many hands-on scripts that
    we will write, and we will explore real-world CI/CD automation scripts and scenarios. This
    chapter will help illustrate the concept of automation by explaining the current
    practices of a fictitious company called Billy Bob's Machine Parts. Billy Bob's
    Machine Parts has a lot of manual processes in place and there is some tension
    between **quality assurance** (**QA**) and the developer team because the software
    releases are only done by the lead developer and all QA testing is done manually.

    work by the UI/UX team tends to be highly visual, and colors mean distinct things.
    The visual aspect of the work tends to imply certain actions that should occur
    during phases of UI flow. Developers tend to work with more concrete items so
    it is not always apparent what natural flows should occur. For instance, if you
    delete an item, *do you bring up a modal*, which is a little window for confirmation,
    or *do you just immediately delete an item*? When submitting a form, *does the
    UI show indications of an error in a certain color and a warning in another color*?
    *What positions should the validation be placed in*? Sometimes, UI interaction
    flows are not described in detail and the developers must go back and forth with
    UI/UX. Documenting why decisions were made in a decision file is important.

    a set of videos teaching customers newer features in each build. Customer success
    is uploading videos through FTP and some of the customer success team spends a
    large part of their day uploading files. Johnny The Automation Bot suggests that
    this process be automated through a script. The script should be intuitive enough
    that any member of the customer success team can run it and it should do the job
    of uploading and retrying the upload if any network latencies occur during the

    prone if the wrong ZIP file is sent. Johnny suggests that the QA department has
    a dedicated URL where all the latest releases live, and that each release be versioned
    and state specific information such as a hotfix. For example, the latest hotfix
    could be `v5.1.0-hotfix 1`, and so, for each hotfix, the QA department would have
    a compressed file that has latest build and a specifier, such as hotfix. If this
    build was a regular build, then it could be named `v5.1.0`.

    UI bug. In particular, if a customer has over 10,000 part listings on a product
    detail page, then the product detail page crashes with no helpful indication of
    what occurred. The developer team discovered that the QA team was manually creating
    new products in the new product page. The developer team helped the QA team by
    making QA aware of an admin endpoint that creates voicemails programmatically.
    The developer team helped write a script that generated new parts programmatically
    and thus saved the QA team from doing the time-consuming task of creating parts
    manually.

- en: David starts talking to the UI/UX team and finds that there is a bottleneck
    between newly exposed API endpoints and the construction of newer pages. The frontend
    developers are mocking out data in these pages and are constantly surprised by
    unexpected JSON payloads. The frontend developers are sometimes waiting for weeks
    for the API endpoint to be published, and instead of sitting by idly, they start
    mocking out data. This has the unintended consequence that they start assuming
    what the data model will look like, which in turn makes changing the page more
    difficult. David lets Victor know that there are tools that exist that can quickly
    scaffold a data model for an endpoint and give the frontend developers the current
    data model for an API endpoint. David starts using Swagger, which is an API design
    framework, as a tool for building newer APIs in the API service. Swagger helps
    reduce the friction between the developer team and the UI/UX team that was unnecessarily
    caused because the UI/UX team was waiting on the data model. Jason, a senior UI/UX
    developer, can now quickly start working on building newer pages because he knows
    exactly what type of payload to expect from newer API endpoints.
